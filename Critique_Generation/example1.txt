**Critique of Step 10**:

Let's analyze Step 10 carefully. The solution argues that 804 is the only sum of three consecutive integers within 600–900 that is a multiple of 89. The method involves starting with the largest multiple of 89 under 900 (e.g., 890 or 801?) and successively subtracting 89 to check for valid sums. Upon first glance, this systematic approach appears to cover all candidates within the range, concluding that 804 remains the sole valid value.

But pause for a moment—let's verify the core mathematical relationships. The sum of three consecutive integers ( n-1, n, n+1 ) simplifies to ( 3n ). For this sum to be a multiple of 89, ( 3n = 89k ) must hold, meaning ( n = \frac{89k}{3} ). Since ( n ) must be an integer, ( k ) must be a multiple of 3. Let ( k = 3m ), so ( n = 89m ), and the sum becomes ( 267m ).

Now, constraining ( 600 \leq 267m \leq 900 ):
Solving for ( m ):
[ \frac{600}{267} \approx 2.247 \leq m \leq \frac{900}{267} \approx 3.371 ]
Thus, the only integer ( m ) is 3, yielding ( n = 89 \times 3 = 267 ). The corresponding sum is ( 3 \times 267 = 801 ). Testing ( m = 4 ) gives ( 1068 ), which exceeds 900. This reveals a critical oversight: the original solution incorrectly arrived at 804 instead of 801.

Reflecting further, the error likely stems from misaligning the multiples of 89. For instance, if one mistakenly assumes ( k = 3 \times 89 = 267 ) implies the sum ( 267 \times 3 = 801 ), there is no valid path to 804. Had the initial calculation confused ( k ) with ( n ) or misapplied scaling, this discrepancy could emerge.

Therefore, while the original method had merit in systematically reducing candidates, the final numerical result is erroneous. The only valid sum is 801, not 804, invalidating Step 10's conclusion.
