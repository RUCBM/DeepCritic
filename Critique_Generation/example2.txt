**Critique of Step 4**:

The Step 4 of solution correctly applies the nth-term formula for an arithmetic sequence, \( a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \), by substituting \( n = 15 \), \( a_1 = 7 \), and the common difference \( d \). The resulting expression, \( a_{15} = 7 + 14d \), is derived through valid arithmetic and aligns with the problem's requirements.

To confirm this rigorously, let's pause and revisit the substitution process:

 - Starting with the formula: \[ a_{15} = 7 + (15-1)d \]
 - Simplifying the term stepwise: \[ a_{15} = 7 + 14d \]

This reiteration confirms no errors in calculation or logic. The step logically follows previous reasoning, as the substitution of values into the formula is unambiguous and the arithmetic is fundamentally sound.

Reflecting further, while the critical points are straightforward here ensuring alignment with arithmetic sequence principles, it's worth emphasizing that no subtler oversights—such as misindexing the term or misapplying the common difference—are present. The step's correctness remains robust under scrutiny.

**Judgement**: The correctness of Step 4 is: \\boxed{1}
