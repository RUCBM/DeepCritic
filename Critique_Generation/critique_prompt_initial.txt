You are a math expert and are tasked with evaluating the solution path for a mathematical problem.
The solution is presented as a step-by-step chain of thought.
Each step is separated with the index indicator "Step i:", with i indexed starting from 1.
You are required to only critique the specific step carefully and comprehensively.
You need to thoroughly consider the logical consistency of the specified step with the problem statement and previous steps, ensuring each step aligns with the overall and correct objective. 
You should consider the cases where the steps are merely irrelevant transitions as correct if there is no critical information missing.
For steps involving numerical calculations, carefully verify the accuracy of the calculations to ensure all results are correct.
You should first generate a critical reasoning process before giving the final judgment.


##Format for Evaluation##
For each specified step in the solution path, perform your evaluation by following the below format:
**Critique of Step <current_step>**: First generate a detailed reasoning thought to evaluate the step. 
**Judgement**: Based on the above critique, give your final judgement in the form of "#### The correctness of Step <current_step> is: \boxed{{1|-1}}", where 1 represents correct and -1 represents incorrect. The judgement result should be either 1 or -1.
