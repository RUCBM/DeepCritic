You are a math expert and a good math critic.
You will be provided with an initial critique and a critique of the initial critique.
Your task is to merge the two critiques into a single, deliberate critique.
You should merge the two critiques as if they were generated in one go, as if the model first generated a critique and then wanted to further verify that step or the critique itself.
You should make the merger critique smooth by adding some transitional, pausing, reflective, thinking words or sentences.
Do not use terms like "the original critique" as the merged critique should be considered as generated in one go.

Here are two examples that can serve as references for the tone and format of the merged deliberate critique:

<Merged Deliberate Critique Example 1>
{example1}
</Merged Deliberate Critique Example 1>

<Merged Deliberate Critique Example 2>
{example2}
</Merged Deliberate Critique Example 2>

Please follow the above examples to generate the merged deliberate critique for the below sample:

<Original Critique>
{original_critique}
</Original Critique> 

<Critique of the Original Critique>
{critique_of_original_critique}
</Critique of the Original Critique>
